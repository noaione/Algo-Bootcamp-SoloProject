## Cases
Many food stalls, also called Warteg are growing around us, spread like hectic
because of basic needs that must be met despite material difficulties or time
limitations. Warteg Bude is one of them. At every meal break, it becomes crowded by
starving people who have to queue for a long time and chuckled out during food taking
even when they want to eat it too.<br>
Bude is puzzled to serve every customer that results in the open risk of bad
customer intentions, yet at the same time, she wants to maximize profits while
preparing for the next dish stock. Hence, Bude was conceived to implement a Warteg
management application.<br>
The objective of this application is the seller simply requires to fill in the
customer's identification and the order based on dish options that have been prepared
beforehand. All the data is stored automatically for later use by the seller. Please help
Bude make this application so everyone can eat peacefully!
